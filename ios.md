# Yale SDMP - iOS Team Self-Guided Training
​
## Intro

Hi there! Welcome to the iOS team.

Before you can be integrated as a fully-functional member of our team, we must make sure that you are up-to-date with the basics of iOS development, which you'll need to know in order to work on our projects. Your first task will be to develop a simple iOS app (specs below) that builds on the parts of the iOS SDK that you should know about. Of course, we also provide you with a list of great resources to help you learn how to build the app.

We hope that after completing this small challenge you'll have identified and filled any gaps in your knowledge of basic iOS development. This will also allow our team to be more productive by making sure that all of our members have the same foundation.


## Task

You mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build one of the apps in the list of ideas below – feel free to **suggest** your own. A basic version of your app should take no more than 12 hours to complete. Once you're done, [upload the project to GitHub](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/) as a public repository and send the link to your team lead.

A couple of important notes before you start:

- This list of ideas is somewhat sorted by level of difficulty.
- These ideas are popular and you're likely to find dozens of open-source iOS projects that implement them if you just Google enough. It is **absolutely crucial that you do not copy code from any of these projects**. You must come up with the code on your own. Preferably, don't even read their code.
- We suggest that you use as little of the Storyboard features as possible. The storyboard can abstract a lot of code on the View Controller that would be cool for you to understand (e.g. segues).

### App Ideas

- **Todo App:** Build an app that stores a list of tasks and allow users to tick them once they've been completed. Users must be able to create/delete/update tasks, tick/untick them, click on a task to view it individually, with info about time it was created, time it was ticked, a possible longer description of it.

## Resources

(Help us keep this list up to date! Let us know if you find something cool that's not here, or better yet, fork this repo and issue a PR.)

### Resources for learning iOS

#### Official resources

Apple’s primary resource for learning iOS development (with Swift) is the [Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) tutorial. At times this tutorial throws a lot at you, so don’t expect it to be easy if you’re not already used to building iOS Apps. As you go through it, take notes, write the code yourself (as opposed to just following along). This will help you solidify the content in your head.

#### Online classes

- **Stanford CS193:** Stanford University has an [online classes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961) that teach you iOS development using Swift. Here are some [great tips](http://qr.ae/THkaGt) you should know if you’re planning on taking this course.
- **Plymouth University:** [This](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/ios-development-in-swift/id950659946) is another recommended course on iOS development using Swift, available on iTunes U.

### Resources for learning Swift

Swift (latest version 3.0.1) is the best option for building iOS apps.

The best option for learning Swift coming from other languages is probably Apple’s [official guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309), which walks you through the most important aspects of the language. The [language reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AboutTheLanguageReference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH29-ID345) is the ultimate resource, which is a little harder to understand and serves as the official documentation for the language. Apple also has a “Learn the Essentials of Swift” tutorial as a prelude to the “Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)” tutorial mentioned above. Make sure to use Xcode’s playground feature to run your swift Swift experiments.

### Resources for learning Objective-C first

Don’t. Learn Swift first. When one is a beginner to iOS, one issue is to learn a language in which to program apps in, and another is to learn how apps work, i.e. how to use the Apple iOS SDK. I believe Swift is much easier to learn and deal with for a beginner than Objective-C. By beginning with Swift, you’ll be able to dedicate most of your time to learning how to use the SDK and build apps.
