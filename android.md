# Yale SDMP - Android Team Self-Guided Training

## Intro

Welcome to the Yale SDMP Developers Android team!

Before we start working together on the next kick-ass Yale app, we need you to
get up to speed with Android development. The goal of this guide is to provide
you with the resources you need to start with Android, or get a refresher if
you're already familiar with it.

## Resources
* To do any Android development, you must be fairly familiar with Java. In case
  you're rusty on that, check out _Lecture 2_ of [Harvard's CS76](http://cs76.tv/2012/spring/).
* Make sure you understand the concept of a class, how polymorphism works
  (inheritance and interfaces), and how to import and use libraries. For more
  information on these topics, [this](http://java2s.com/Book/Java/CatalogJava.htm)
  is a great online resource.
* Once you think you're familiar enough with Java, you need to start looking at
  Android specifics. Fortunately, Android is a very well-documented platform.
  Google does a good job at maintaining the [Android Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html).
* Google provides the Android development environment, Android Studio, for free.
  Although you can use other tool stacks, we encourage you to use the latest
  version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
  for compatibility with the rest of the team.
* For starters, especially if you haven't written any Android before, we refer you
  to the official [beginner tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html).
* This tutorial should get you familiar with the Android application life-cycle.
  It introduces the basic Android concepts, such as _Activities_, _Views_,
  _Intents_, and UI layouts. Through the tutorial, you should also learn how to
  utilize the various features that Android devices provide.
* [CodePath](https://guides.codepath.com/android) is another wonderful resource
  for both the basics and the more advanced concepts. 

## The Task
We believe that the best way to learn is practice. This task will hopefully get
you more familiar with Android views, fragments, HTTP handlers, using online
APIs, and UI/UX.

For this task, you will build a gallery app that:

- Pulls its data from [Yale's Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/yaleuniversity/sets/)
  (see [Flickr API](flickr.com/services/api/)).
- Displays the images in an appealing way (get creative!).
- Allows viewing individual images (in a separate window or the same one - up to
  you).

That's it really. As for delivery, please host the project on a public git
repository, and provide us with the link.

Good luck!
